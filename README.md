## Introduction
Preconfirmations are a mechanism that allows block proposers to commit to a block's contents before it is included in the blockchain. Follow the Ethereum Sequencing and Preconfirmations calls [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrm4ZUoj9xY&list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHDFarAcF29QfdMlUpReZrR).
